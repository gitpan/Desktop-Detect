DESCRIPTION

    This module uses several heuristics to find out what desktop
    environment is currently running, along with extra information.

FUNCTIONS

 detect_desktop() => HASHREF

    Return a hashref containing information about running desktop
    environment and extra information.

    Detection is done from the cheapest methods, e.g. looking at
    environment variables. Several environment variables are checked, e.g.
    DESKTOP_SESSION, XDG_DESKTOP_SESSION, etc.

    Result:

      * desktop => STR

      Possible values: xfce, kde-plasma, gnome, cinnamon, lxde, openbox, or
      empty string (if can't detect any desktop environment running).
